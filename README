NAME

Business::ISP

This system is a client account and billing manager geared
to an ISP-type business. It allows note/problem tracking,
client personal and account information management, plugs
into direct banking systems for live-time account renewals,
ties directly into your RADIUS database for usage information,
etc.

It has its own built in sanity and error checker, and web
GUI that includes operator login, session time-outs etc.

There are schema files for a MySQL database in the src/schema
directory, and when running its tests, uses a temporary copy
of an SQLite database, also with a schema in the same directory.

Although functional, it is still in heavy development. I
haven't coded anything within this system for a year or so,
and am currently making sweeping changes, most of all the
cleanup of redundant and repetitive code, and smoothing out
the dependency trees.

Things WILL change.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    (The install is problematic at best)

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	
	Note: if you run into errors while running 'make test', find out
	      which file is causing grief (eg. t/21-audit.t), and run 
		  'perl t/21-audit.t'.
		
		  Many of the test files have diagnostic printouts on what is
		  wrong, and potential solutions on how to fix.

	make install

Eagle

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	
	Note: if you run into errors while running 'make test', find out
	      which file is causing grief (eg. t/21-audit.t), and run 
		  'perl t/21-audit.t'.
		
		  Many of the test files have diagnostic printouts on what is
		  wrong, and potential solutions on how to fix.

	make install

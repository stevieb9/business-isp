- removed all instances of site-specific names (some functions may
  have broken as a result)

  and repository links

0.12
- major inroads into the Reporting framework
- new functions to manage CGI sessions
- more granular returns for the ledgers
- system can now identify a devel/test system from a production one by
  simply including a lower-case 'd' at the end of the version number in

- API CHANGE: Reports::total_by_payment_type to income_by_payment_type()
- three other reports written
- ISP::Email config is saved across re-installations

  numbers, starting from one

Notable bug fixes:

           conversion
